# A Calendar UI

## Usage

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Summary

Try to implement the UI relying on @material-ui library, writing as minimal
local CSS as possible. You should try to utilize properties, and the overrides.

is your friend, as well as

Ideally the datepicker should work so that when a date is picked, only the tasks
and appointments for that date should be visible. Just assume current date is
June 12th. Try to limit the amount of time you spent around ~3 hours, and let's
see how much you'll get done. Remember, functionality > pixel perfection. It is
completely ok if you won't finish the whole thing.
