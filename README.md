# A Calendar UI

## Usage

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Summary

Try to implement the UI relying on @material-ui library, writing
as minimal local CSS as possible. You should try to utilize properties,
and the overrides.

is your friend, as well as

Ideally the datepicker should work so that when a date is picked, only
the tasks and appointments for that date should be visible. Just assume
current date is June 12th. Try to limit the amount of time you spent
around ~3 hours, and let's see how much you'll get done. Remember,
functionality > pixel perfection. It is completely ok if you won't
finish the whole thing.
